  abstract  = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct methods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathfrak{\{}sim{\}}(3){\$}                , thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

  abstract  = {We present a simple, effective method for solving structure from motion problems by averaging epipolar geometries. Based on recent successes in solving for global camera rotations using averaging schemes, we focus on the problem of solving for 3D camera translations given a network of noisy pairwise camera translation directions (or 3D point observations). To do this well, we have two main insights. First, we propose a method for removing outliers from problem instances by solving simpler low-dimensional subproblems, which we refer to as 1DSfM problems. Second, we present a simple, principled averaging scheme. We demonstrate this new method in the wild on Internet photo collections.},
