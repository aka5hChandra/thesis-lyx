  abstract  = {We present a simple, effective method for solving structure from motion problems by averaging epipolar geometries. Based on recent successes in solving for global camera rotations using averaging schemes, we focus on the problem of solving for 3D camera translations given a network of noisy pairwise camera translation directions (or 3D point observations). To do this well, we have two main insights. First, we propose a method for removing outliers from problem instances by solving simpler low-dimensional subproblems, which we refer to as 1DSfM problems. Second, we present a simple, principled averaging scheme. We demonstrate this new method in the wild on Internet photo collections.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

  abstract  = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct methods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathfrak{\{}sim{\}}(3){\$}                , thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new approach to calculating the inverse of radial distortions. The method presented here provides a model of reverse radial distortion, currently modeled by a polynomial expression, that proposes another polynomial expression where the new coefficients are a function of the original ones. After describing the state of the art, the proposed method is developed. It is based on a formal calculus involving a power series used to deduce a recursive formula for the new coefficients. We present several implementations of this method and describe the experiments conducted to assess the validity of the new approach. Such an approach, non-iterative, using another polynomial expression, able to be deduced from the first one, can actually be interesting in terms of performance, reuse of existing software, or bridging between different existing software tools that do not consider distortion from the same point of view.},

  abstract  = {This chapter uses the camera virtualization approach to offer a unified treatment of various structured light depth cameras. Readers will learn how these cameras can differ in characteristics like number of cameras, baseline, position of the projector, and projected patterns. We also present fundamentals of illuminator design, the most critical component of structured light depth cameras, using the concept of uniqueness, and explore its implementation by wavelength, range, time, and space multiplexing. Various non-idealities of structured light depth cameras are also explained. In the last part of the chapter, theoretical ideas are applied to an analysis of the most popular structured light depth camera products in the market, like the Primesense Camera used in the Kinect v1 and other more recent products, such as the Intel RealSense F200 and R200.},

  abstract  = {All current ToF depth camera products in the market are based on the In-Pixel Photo-Mixing Devices technology. This chapter introduces operations of continuous wave homodyne amplitude modulation systems within In-Pixel devices both for sinusoidal and square wave modulation cases. The chapter details various implementation issues affecting the practical operation and performance of ToF depth cameras which readers should be aware of, including flying pixels and multipath interference. The last part of the chapter synthesizes the theory by analyzing the most popular ToF depth camera products, including products from Mesa Imaging, PMD, and Softkinetics, as well as the second generation Kinect.},
